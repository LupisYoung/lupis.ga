            <p>The wind blows through the trees, crisp and cool. The forest is silent save for the gentle rustling of leaves beneath the treads of two wolves as they walk in the shade. The sun slowly begins to sink beyond the horizon, casting them in greater and greater shadow beneath the trees. The brilliant orange hues of the sky just about match the auburn fur covering their bodies; their deep maroon locks would soon follow as the night draws closer.<br>
			<br>
			The crunching of leaves echoes off of the surrounding trunks as the smaller wolf trots alongside the other, the larger’s footsteps thumping heavily as his tremendous footfalls are backed by several hundred pounds of muscle and heft. He has to take twice the steps to keep stride with him, his own body much slimmer and svelte yet still lithe and athletic.<br>
			<br>	
			A brisk gust of wind rushes through the woods, the smaller wolf’s fur standing on end as his tanktop does little to protect him from the chill of the drawing night. He quickly shivers and draws closer to his companion who reaches a gentle and warm arm around his shoulders.<br>
			<br>
			“I told you you should have brought a jacket,” the larger wolf chides with a soft smile.<br>
			<br>
			“I didn’t think it was going to get this cold,” the smaller wolf whines, his ears drooping a little in defeat.<br>
			<br>
			“Hemk…” the bigger wolf chuckles with a roll of his eyes, “You just wanted an excuse for me to put my arm around you.”<br>
			<br>
			The smaller wolf can’t help but chuckle bashfully, “I can’t say it’s not nice…I like our walks…”<br>
			<br>
			The larger wolf nods contentedly and pulls the smaller wolf into him, his ponderous bulk seemingly sucking the younger canid’s body into him. Together they continue to stride side by side, the wind no longer a factor to either of them. The smaller wolf blushes as he enjoys the warmth and comfort. He feels safe. Protected.<br>
			<br>
			“Hey. big woof?” he looks up with a curious gaze.<br>
			<br>
			“Yeah, Loop?”<br>
			<br>
			“Do you….remember the day we first met?”<br>
			<br>
			The large wolf looks down to see Lupis staring up at him intently, his eyes filled with a determination that was abnormal in the young wolf.<br>
			<br>
			“I do…” he responds tentatively, curious as to where the question would lead.<br>
			<br>
			Lup nods and looks at the ground, “I just…that day will always stick with me…” He could feel a lump forming in his throat, his eyes diverting to the ground as the memories come flooding back. “I was so scared…stuck in that little box…left all by myself…”<br>
			<br>
			“Lupis…” concern begins to spread over the big wolf’s face.<br>
			<br>
			“I don’t know why my parents didn’t want me…what I had done wrong…” the smaller wolf could feel tears stinging his eyes. “All I knew was that I was cold and alone. Stuck with nobody to care for a little pup…I was so scared.” He huddles closer, sinking his face deeper into the warm fur of his elder, “And I remember seeing you emerging almost out of nowhere. You looked so big and strong…I was a little intimidated.”<br>
			<br>
			The big wolf can’t help a small smirk crossing his face, “I remember you huddling into the corner of that box alright. You were shaking like a leaf.”<br>
			<br>
			Lupis chuckles, “Yeah…I was scared…but then you reached out and took me in your arms and immediately I felt safe. Your hands were so warm and soft…just like your fur…”<br>
			<br>
			“And then I took you home…cleaned you up…and the rest is history,” the large wolf finishes. “So you want to tell me why you’re thinking about all that?”<br>
			<br>
			Lupis wipes his eyes as the two of them clear the edge of the forest, “I’m always thinking about it.”<br>
			<br>
			“Why?”<br>
			<br>
			“Because it means so much to me. You took me in for no reason, gave me a home…a family…fed me, clothed me, washed me. You didn’t even know me.”<br>
			<br>
			“I knew I couldn’t leave a helpless little pup all on his own,” the big wolf speaks firmly, pulling the small wolf in tighter as they make their way to the crest of a small hill overlooking a large clearing where they eventually take a seat in the grass. “There was no way I was letting you stay stuck in the mortal world without a proper place to call home.”<br>
			<br>
			“You know it was two years ago today, right?”<br>
			<br>
			“You remember that?”<br>
			<br>
			Lupis nods, “I’ll never forget that day…” he slowly twiddles the ring around his finger - one that matches the ring surrounding the same digit as the larger wolf. “It changed my life. I probably would have died without you.” <br>
			<br>
			He twists the ring, plucking it from his finger and a few shimmering sparkles begin to flow around him as his magic begins to override that of his father’s. His auburn hues begin to grow dark and gray as the last remnants of the day fade into night. The cream fur around his face nearly turns black while the pink pads on his hands change to match the color of his eyes. He blinks and his sapphire eyes are replaced with rubies.<br>
			<br>
			Lupis sighs as he looks down at his fur, examining himself for a moment, “I remember the day you gave me my fur. It…made everything official.” He chokes back a fresh wave of tears, “I really do look like your son when I wear it.”<br>
			<br>
			The big wolf sighs and sets the smaller wolf into his lap, hugging him tightly, “You don’t need my fur to be my son, Loop.”<br>
			<br>
			“I know…but it just…helps. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for me…”<br>
			<br>
			The big wolf gently reaches down and resets the ring onto Lupis’ finger. “Then make sure not to lose your ring, you goof.”<br>
			<br>
			Lupis watches as the shimmering sparkles emerge around him once more, his fur changing color to match that of his father. He can feel the power of his father wrapping around him, adorning him almost like a near-constant embrace. He nods in agreement, trying to keep himself steady inside of those strong arms.<br>
			<br>
			“I can’t thank you enough for everything you’ve done for me.”<br>
			<br>
			“You don’t have to,” the big guy smiles, “Let’s just watch the stars, eh?”<br>
			<br>
			Lupis nods, sniffling once as he shifts into the lap beneath him before looking up into the deep navy sky as the first of the stars begin to flare into view. He feels so safe and secure within those strong arms that sleep quickly starts to take hold. He can feel the overwhelming warmth from his fathers love sinking deep into him. A grin spreads over his muzzle.<br>
			<br>
			“I love you, Geo,” he mutters before slipping off into sleep.<br>
			<br>
			Geo chuckles and runs his fingers through his son’s hair, “I love you too, Loop…”
